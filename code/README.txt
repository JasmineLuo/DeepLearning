(1) The imagenet-vgg-f.mat is in this folder, both part1 and part2 are used for this project.
(2) Some path might be changed if run on another computer.
(3) The part 2 can be quite slow to process (it took more than one night on my computer). 
	But the trend is obvious, that the accuracy stays around certain level after 20 epochs.
Thank you for your patience.
