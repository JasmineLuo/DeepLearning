Dear prof and TA,

The handing time is one day late, and I'm using one of three free delay days for this project.

Due to the upload size constraint, Matconvnet-1.0-beta16 is not in this parcel.
All the code used are in code parcel.
Both part 1 (accuuracy >50%) and part 2 (accuracy > 87%) is worked for graduate credit.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards.

For Github, trained imagenet-vgg-f.mat is not included due to size limit.
